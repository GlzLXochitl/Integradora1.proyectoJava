# Breadcrumbsloguin-metods

This repository contains the loguin-metods project, developed as part of the Integrator course work at the university. In this project, different methods of authentication and login are explored, both client-side and server-side. The main objective was to understand the basic principles of authentication and develop a simple but functional system that integrates frontend and backend in a coordinated way.
